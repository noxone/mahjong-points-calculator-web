# App Icons
This folder contains the icon for the Mahjong Points Calculator. The icon is derived from the tile for [Bamboo 1](../tiles/bamboo1.svg).

## Generate Icons
The folder only contains the SVG file that shows the used icon. All other required files can be generated using [``generate_icons.sh``](./generate_icons.sh).

The script needs [`imagemagick`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/imagemagick) and [`librsvg`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/librsvg) to work. Both can be installed e.g. via Homebrew.

And using [pwa-asset-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pwa-asset-generator) I will probably create some splash screens for iOS devices once the PWA part is done.
